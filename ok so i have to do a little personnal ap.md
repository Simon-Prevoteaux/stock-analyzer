ok so i have to do a little personnal app.

goal of the app is for me to do some analysis on stocks. There are probably some existing stuff and also paying ones, but i would like to have my own personnal stuff
my goal is to be able to get metrics on stocks, and then compare those, and then try to evaluate their pricing (overvalued or value play)

You did some analysis like this for me and generated this file, i like this and i would like this to be replicated in a way.

I'm open minded on the method, but having something like market cap, revenue, earnings, P/S, EPS, P/E, forward P/E and growth rate would be good. I also like to aggregate the results to be able to compare , like a screener.

From a technical standpoint : 
- all in python 
- create a virtual env for lib 
- create libs for fetching data and all utilities 
- create a flask app for visualisation, make this kind of separated in a nice way, i want the app to be well - structured 
- if you need to store data, please use sql lite or something local on a file
